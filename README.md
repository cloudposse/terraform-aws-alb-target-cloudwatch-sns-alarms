It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases).


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using `bats` and `Terratest`, see [test](test).

```hcl
module "alb_alarms" {
  source                  = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-alb-target-group-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  namespace               = "eg"
  stage                   = "staging"
  name                    = "app"
  alb_arn_suffix          = "XXXXXXXXX"
  target_group_arn_suffix = "YYYYYYYYY"
}
```
